## Requirements
1. Python 3.5
2. OpenCV
3. PyTorch 0.4

## Detection Example

### On single or multiple images

Clone, and `cd` into the repo directory. The first thing you need to do is to get the weights file
This time around, for v3, authors has supplied a weightsfile only for COCO [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights), and place 

the weights file into your repo directory. Or, you could just type (if you're on Linux)

```
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights 
python detect.py --images imgs --det det 
```


`--images` flag defines the directory to load images from, or a single image file (it will figure it out), and `--det` is the directory
to save images to. Other setting such as batch size (using `--bs` flag) , object threshold confidence can be tweaked with flags that can be looked up with. 

```
python detect.py -h
```
### On Video
For this, you should run the file, video_demo.py with --video flag specifying the video file. The video file should be in .avi format
since openCV only accepts OpenCV as the input format. 

```
python video_demo.py --video video.avi
```

Tweakable settings can be seen with -h flag. 

### On a Camera
Same as video module, but you don't have to specify the video file since feed will be taken from your camera. To be precise, 
feed will be taken from what the OpenCV, recognises as camera 0. The default image resolution is 160 here, though you can change it with `reso` flag.

```
python cam_demo.py
```
